Here are its key principles:\n\n• Wave-Particle Duality: All particles exhibit both wave and particle properties. This was demonstrated in the double-slit experiment, where electrons behave as both particles and waves.\n\n• Uncertainty Principle: Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that we cannot simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect precision. The more precisely we measure one property, the less precisely we can know the other.\n\n• Superposition: Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. This is illustrated by Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where the cat is both alive and dead until observed.\n\n• Quantum Entanglement: When particles become entangled, the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others, regardless of distance separating them.\n\n• Quantization: Physical properties like energy or angular momentum are quantized, meaning they can only take on discrete values rather than continuous ones.\n\n• Wave Function and Probability: A wave function (Ψ) describes quantum systems, with its square giving the probability of finding a particle in a specific state or position.\n\nThese principles form the foundation of quantum mechanics, which has led to technologies like lasers, transistors, and MRI machines, and continues to drive research in quantum computing and cryptography."}]}
