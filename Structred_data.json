        "page_content": "The premier ensemble of the University of North Texas choral program, the 52-voice A Cappella Choir, led by Dr. Allen Hightower, director of choral studies, is selected by competitive audition from among the more than 1,500 music majors within the College of Music. Founded in 1938 by Wilfred Bain, the choir has enjoyed a rich performance history including a three-month tour of Europe under the sponsorship of the US Department of State in 1966. The choir was featured on the closing concert of the 2005 American Choral Directors Association national convention in Los Angeles and on the 1999 national convention in Chicago, and has made numerous appearances at conventions of the Texas Music Educators Association. The University of North Texas Baroque Orchestra offers students one of the rare opportunities in North America to study and perform at a high level on period instruments. Students who are admitted into the orchestra are frequently given scholarships for study on period instruments. Generally the orchestra includes 10 violins, 3 violas, 2 cellos and violone as well as a complete assemblage of wind instruments, including baroque oboes, bassoons, flutes, trumpets, horns, recorders, and a full set of continuo instruments such as harpsichord, organ, theorbos, guitars and lutes. The Orchestra has performed several places in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma as well as twice at the Boston Early Music Festival. Vox Aquilae is an ensemble of 18-24 singers who specialize in the performance of music from the 16th through the 18th centuries and which usually performs with the University of North Texas Baroque Orchestra. The choir consists of members of the other student choirs, plus graduate students in voice or early music. The repertoire is extensive. In 2011, 2013, and 2015 Vox Aquilae, along with the Baroque Orchestra, were invited to perform at the Boston Early Music Festival, the premiere such festival in the world. In June 2012, 14 members of Vox Aquilae were invited to perform the Victoria Requiem at the Berkeley Early Music Festival--that performance, recorded live, can be found here. Their performance from December of 2011 of the Vivaldi Gloria on YouTube has had more than 1,500,000 hits. The choir, formerly known as the Collegium Singers, also performed at the National Collegiate Choral Organization convention in Portland, OR in November 2015. The University of North Texas Brass Band provides students with the unique opportunity to perform in one of the most widely known wind mediums throughout the world. Similar to the British style Brass Band, the American style Brass Band provides its members the opportunity to develop the highest standards of technical and musical playing. Emphasis is given to the development of tone quality, intonation, rhythm, and virtuosic technique through performance of a wide variety of literature, including masterwork transcriptions, traditional marches and original works.",

The policies and procedures are regularly reviewed in coordination with the University of North Texas Division of Advancement staff to ensure their adequacy, efficiency, and effectiveness. The UNT Foundation is committed to responsibility, ethics and accountability through its committees’ structure, which is designed to fulfill the responsibilities of the Board. UNT Foundation’s Board of Directors and executive staff stay current on a wide array of issues that impact higher educational institutions through active involvement with leading national associations and professional education groups. Articles of incorporation is a set of formal documents filed with the government body to legally document the creation of a corporation. The UNT Foundation filed their Articles of Incorporation on June 27, 1972. A determination letter is the only official document and proof that an organization is recognized as a tax-exempt organization. The IRS issues this letter after an organization has successfully applied for the recognition of tax-exempt status. In this document the IRS indicates under which sections of the Internal Revenue Code the organization is qualified. The Employer ID number assigned to the UNT Foundation by the IRS is unique and may not be used by other entities. The UNT Foundation has proprietary rights to financial and other information which the UNT Foundation deems confidential unless and until such information is officially made public. Such information includes, but is not limited to, donor and membership lists, unpublished information, unpublished financial information, specialized processes, and techniques used in connection with the UNT Foundation’s activities, and protection and security systems of the UNT Foundation. High standards, ethical behavior, personal integrity, and impartiality are inherent to the reputation and ultimate success of the UNT Foundation. In keeping with these norms, UNT Foundation officers, directors, advisory directors, and staff refrain from engaging in any behavior that might be construed as self-dealing or in conflict with the mission, goals, and fundamental purpose of the UNT Foundation., The board of directors accomplishes much of its work through its standing committees, which are specifically focused on key areas of responsibility. The Board committee structure enhances Board productivity and brings unique expertise to bear to monitor operations, make decisions within the parameters of committee charters, and frame policy recommendations to the Board for discussion and action. Audit CommitteeThe primary responsibility of the Audit Committee is to manage the UNT Foundation’s annual external audit, as well as provide oversight over its financial practices, internal controls, financial management, and standards of conduct. Budget CommitteeThe Budget Committee’s responsibilities are to ensure development of viable annual and long-range financial plans for the UNT Foundation, oversight of current financial operations and results, and adequacy and accounting for the Foundation’s reserves. Governance CommitteeThe responsibility of the Governance Committee is to develop, recommend, and oversee the UNT Foundation’s by-laws, Board governance practices, and policies. The Committee additionally functions as the nominating committee of the Board. Investment CommitteeThe Investment Committee fulfills the UNT Foundation’s responsibilities for prudent management of investments for endowments and other institutional pools of capital. The Committee works closely with staff and professional advisors to establish the portfolio’s investment allocation, select investments, review performance and reporting, and set the endowment spend rate. The UNT Foundation’s Board exercises fiduciary responsibility for the investments, providing governance and oversight over the Foundation’s investment and spending policies. Personnel CommitteeThe Personnel Committee develops, recommends and oversees personnel policies, employee benefit programs, compensation practices, and the performance evaluation process for the Foundation’s staff and CEO. Trust Management & Real Estate CommitteeThe primary responsibility of the Trust Management & Real Estate Committee is to oversee prudent investment and administration of charitable trusts, gift annuities, life insurance policies, bequests, and gifts of real estate or other properties to the UNT Foundation.

        "page_content": "For several decades, the University of North Texas operated an observatory site, just north of Denton, at the site of a decommissioned Nike missile base. This facility served the university quite well, for its small astronomy laboratory classes, as well as the monthly open houses for the public. However, the astronomy program continued to grow and Denton's growth began to extend north, causing due concern with increased traffic and light pollution. It became evident by 2005 that the UNT Observatory needed to find a new home. After a careful search, the perfect site was located west of Denton, near the Denton Municipal Airport and construction began in Spring 2006. Dedicated in 2007, the Rafes Urban Astronomy Center (RUAC) is named after Richard Rafes, former vice president of administrative affairs at UNT, and his wife, Tommye, who donated the land for the center. In addition to the generous land donation for the observatory, Richard and Tommye Rafes also donated an adjacent plot of land, which will someday become a public parking area. Today the site is home to four telescope huts, each housing four Celestron C8 telescopes, and 2 classrooms which are used for astronomy student laboratories. Two large domes were assembled on site in September 2006 for community outreach programs and house an 8\" refractor and a spectacular 6\" Unitron refractor. In the Fall of 2008, The Hudson Amphitheater made its debut at the RUAC, nestled between the 2 large domes. Constructed using recycled materials, this outdoor amphitheater was funded in part through a donation from the M.R. and Evelyn Hudson Foundation of Keller. It features sturdy, movable benches which can accommodate up to 60 people. This serves as the primary congregation spot for talks about the night sky during public outreach events, such as Star Parties, held on the first and third Saturday of every month. One of the first of its kind in a major metropolitan area in the United States, this site continues to flourish. With roughly 3,000 astronomy students and more than 1,000 visitors using this facility, annually, the Rafes Urban Astronomy Center has become one of the brightest spots in the Mean Green Universe. Are you interested in stargazing and learning more about constellations and deep sky objects? The Rafes Urban Astronomy Center is open every first and third Saturday of the month, forpublic Star Parties. Perfect for family outings! For more informationclick here!",

        "page_content": "Citing sources accurately is an important aspect of academic writing. Though citations may vary depending on the type of resource and writing style, the purpose of citations is to uniquely identify sources so that information can be shared easily and used ethically. The basic parts of a citation each help to identify the source and usually include elements such as author, title, publisher name and location, series information (volume, issue, or edition), date of publication, and location within the text or website. Additional elements such as a DOI or distributor may be added to further uniquely identify certain types of resources. Citations almost always have two parts. The embedded (or in-text) citation alerts the audience that an external source of information is present and points them to a specific entry on a comprehensive list of sources by uniquely identifying the work or creator. The list of cited sources, sometimes called a reference list or works cited page, is the second part of the citation. The list contains all information needed to accurately identify and access the same source that was cited within the body of the work. Anytime the work or idea of another is used it should be given proper credit through the inclusion of a citation. There are primarily two methods of using outside sources in your work, quoting and paraphrasing, and both methods require that a two-part citation be included in order to identify the source. When questioning whether or not to cite a source, consider the following: If the answer is yes to any of these questions, it is likely that a citation is needed. When in doubt, remember it is better to include a citation than to leave it out and risk plagiarism. The Writing Center has tutors for both undergraduates and graduates who can assist you with citing. See also theirResources pagefor citation style handouts.

        "page_content": "The Spark is a student focused service division within the UNT Libraries. As a unique combination of a hands-on experiential learning space (a makerspace) and a library circulating collection, our primary focus is providing access to a wide range of resources to not only support but enhance your UNT educational experience. The Spark’s vision is to promote the cooperative and creative use of resources to support the continual development of the maker mindset within the UNT community. As such we strive to foster innovation and exploration of –creative ideas to engage in the learning process in an inclusive and collaborative space.

The Spark's mission is to ignite the imagination, encourage exploration, and facilitate learning at the intersection of theoretical knowledge and physical application across disciplines. The Spark endeavors to increase digital fluency, inspire explorative learning, support resume building, and encourage personal growth and development of a maker mindset. The maker mindset builds confidence in an individual's ownership of the process and understanding the connection between the challenge and the outcome. Maker-centered learning has the ability to grow an individual's skill set in critical thinking, communication, and collaboration while working in a cross-disciplinary environment. Our team members come from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. You can easily identify them from their grey vests, and they will always be happy to assist you. The Spark at DP is in its new home! At Discovery Park, the Spark is now located in the B wing inside the main Library room B135! Comes see the new space!

In the event you find you have supplies, tools, or resources that you want to give, please consider the makerspace. This is a list to give an idea, but it is not all inclusive. If you have something you would like to donate pleasecontact us. The Willis location places a strong emphasis on fostering a dynamic learning environment within the heart of the library.

        "page_content": "Open Access information is digital information that is online, free of charge, and free, in varying degrees, of most copyright and licensing restrictions. Open Access resources typically permit users to download, copy, print, display, distribute, search, index, and link to the information; Open Access resources remain the intellectual property of their creators, who have attribution rights as well as control over the integrity of their work. See more inour glossary of terms. While the notion of Open Access to scholarly information is not new, widespread access to the Web has fostered interest in the possibilities of Open Access and has accelerated the formation of a global advocacy movement that encompasses authors, researchers, academics, funding organizations, universities, libraries, users and the general public. Additional stakeholders include government entities, commercial publishers, professional associations and societies, and numerous producers of scholarly works. Open Access @ UNT is an initiative to engage and inform our UNT Community Members in a variety of efforts to promote adoption of Open Access policies and practices, to participate in the global Open Access movement, and to provide an online space for information, resources and discussion regarding Open Access. TheUNT Faculty Senateunanimously approved a university-wideOpen Access Policyon March 9, 2011 and unanimously approved a revision on November 8, 2017. In 2012, a group of technologists and librarians, scholars and researchers, university administrators, and other stakeholders promulgatedThe Denton Declaration, a manifesto that bridges the converging interests of these stakeholders and promotes collaboration, transparency, and accountability across organizational and disciplinary boundaries. TheUNT Scholarly Worksrepository serves as a central archive for the long-term preservation and access to our UNT Community Members' research, creative and scholarly activities. In addition, ourUNT Data Repositoryhouses datasets of the valuable research from our UNT Community. Both repositories are hosted in our UNT Digital Library. Under the sponsorship of UNTsOffice of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs,(UNT College of Information, URL:\"http://ci.unt.edu/\"), and theUNT Libraries, the annualOpen Access Symposiumwas created as a catalyst to move UNT and other academic institutions in Texas forward in consideration of institutional Open Access policies. The events feature nationally and interanationally recognized leaders in the Open Access movement. In February 2018, UNT became the seventh US institution and first outside California to sign the OA2020 Expression of Interest [(more, URL:\"https://library.unt.edu/news/2018/oa2020/\")]. Effective January 2021, UNT requires that PIs for grants from all federal agencies and from others requiring a data-management plan (DMP) share the DMP and an inventory of grant products in the UNT Digital Library [(more, URL:\"https://research.unt.edu/research-services/pi-handbook/research-proposal-preparation/public-access-research-using-data\")]. UNT is a founding member of theHigher Education Leadership Initiative for Open Scholarship (HELIOS).

        "page_content": "(Read the Official Notice from President Smatresk, URL:\"https://www.unt.edu/notices/SOTU-spring2021\") As student debt grows nationwide and prospective students and parents assess the cost of higher education at record levels, UNT unveiled a number of affordability initiatives Feb. 3, that are meant to help students limit debt while still receiving a Tier One education as they earn their college degree. During State of the University Part II, UNT President Neal Smatresk announced UNT will not raise tuition for the third consecutive year and outlined six new affordability initiatives focused on integrated student financial support, affordable learning materials, food and housing insecurity, on-campus student wages, staff minimum wage, and offering a budget coaching and financial management tool to full-time employees. “We've watched our students struggle to stay in school, we've witnessed that they have food and housing insecurities, and we see student debt rising nationally,” Smatresk said. “It's crystal clear that for the good of our students, to help transform their lives, to maintain a robust economy in our state and beyond, and for our continued success, we have to reverse this downward financial spiral.” The first prong of UNT's affordability initiative already is in place, as many scholarship awards have been reallocated for first-time and transfer students, expanding the number of students eligible for awards, as well as making transfer scholarships competitive with other regional schools. “The net impact of these changes in our approach is that we can serve our mission of giving more students, especially first-generation students and those with more need, the opportunity to stay in school. We will make a UNT education more affordable, and we also will limit student debt, which is a major strategic goal,” Smatresk said. Additionally, UNT has committed to six new affordability initiatives to improve the financial well-being for students, faculty, and staff. The first is the creation of an Integrated Student Financial Support Center, which will bring together technology and web resources to provide students seamless interactions with Student Financial Services, Student Financial Aid and Scholarships and Student Money Management. By building on the Start Green, Stay Green initiative and creating an “easy button” for financial assistance, the Integrated Student Financial Support Center will provide students a common interface between areas, facilitate seamless phone and virtual support and limit the UNT runaround for students while also limiting debt. Additionally, Smatresk is calling on every department and faculty member to reduce the cost of course materials and textbooks for students by using Affordable Learning Materials whenever possible. After realizing expensive textbooks and homework systems were inhibiting her students' progress, chemistry lecturer Amy Petros redesigned her course using Open Education Resources, saving 1,000 students nearly $300,000 to date. UNT will help faculty access high quality pre-existing Open Educational Resources or create their own curated collections to reduce the costs for students. “Even saving a few hundred dollars every semester can have a major impact helping our students pay the rent or get gas for their commute,” Smatresk said. To address food and housing insecurity, a growing need among many UNT students, Smatresk calls for the university to expand its housing and dining award programs, clarify the housing waiver process for FTIC commuters, establish a short-term emergency housing program, partner with apartment operators to provide intermediate-term housing, provide campus locker access and nap locations, and establish dining donation programs for peer-to-peer assistance. Student employment and wages is another area under review and Smatresk announced UNT will conduct a comprehensive analysis of on-campus student wages and hiring processes to identify opportunities to make campus jobs more meaningful to student career progression, improve the process of finding a good match between student skills and departmental needs, make it easier for departments to hire qualified work study students, and to improve the quality of the experience for our student employees. UNT also will assess the impact of increasing student wages. Another affordability initiative focuses on ensuring all full-time staff are paid a living wage, by increasing the minimum wage to $12/hour March 1 for full-time staff who have worked at UNT for 90 days or more. “This is nearly a 30% increase in pay from our current minimum wage for some of our hardest working staff. We'll further analyze compensation of our employees over the next year to develop a plan that continues to support our lowest paid staff members,” Smatresk said. The final initiative announced provides financial education and budget coaching to all full-time employees through the SmartDollar program. Currently in use by colleagues at the UNT Health Science Center, Smatresk said offering it to UNT employees is one way to help employees attain financial well-being. “This plan hits a number of our major strategic objectives in significant and measurable ways,” Smatresk said. “It should improve retention, engage our students more deeply, limit or lower their debt, graduate students faster, improve our student-facing processes, and support the financial well-being of students, faculty, and staff members.”",

        "page_content": "Open Access information is digital information that is online, free of charge, and free, in varying degrees, of most copyright and licensing restrictions. Open Access resources typically permit users to download, copy, print, display, distribute, search, index, and link to the information; Open Access resources remain the intellectual property of their creators, who have attribution rights as well as control over the integrity of their work. See more inour glossary of terms. While the notion of Open Access to scholarly information is not new, widespread access to the Web has fostered interest in the possibilities of Open Access and has accelerated the formation of a global advocacy movement that encompasses authors, researchers, academics, funding organizations, universities, libraries, users and the general public. Additional stakeholders include government entities, commercial publishers, professional associations and societies, and numerous producers of scholarly works. Open Access @ UNT is an initiative to engage and inform our UNT Community Members in a variety of efforts to promote adoption of Open Access policies and practices, to participate in the global Open Access movement, and to provide an online space for information, resources and discussion regarding Open Access. TheUNT Faculty Senateunanimously approved a university-wideOpen Access Policyon March 9, 2011 and unanimously approved a revision on November 8, 2017. In 2012, a group of technologists and librarians, scholars and researchers, university administrators, and other stakeholders promulgatedThe Denton Declaration, a manifesto that bridges the converging interests of these stakeholders and promotes collaboration, transparency, and accountability across organizational and disciplinary boundaries. TheUNT Scholarly Worksrepository serves as a central archive for the long-term preservation and access to our UNT Community Members' research, creative and scholarly activities. In addition, ourUNT Data Repositoryhouses datasets of the valuable research from our UNT Community. Both repositories are hosted in our UNT Digital Library. Under the sponsorship of UNTsOffice of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs,(UNT College of Information, URL:\"http://ci.unt.edu/\"), and theUNT Libraries, the annualOpen Access Symposiumwas created as a catalyst to move UNT and other academic institutions in Texas forward in consideration of institutional Open Access policies. The events feature nationally and interanationally recognized leaders in the Open Access movement. In February 2018, UNT became the seventh US institution and first outside California to sign the OA2020 Expression of Interest [(more, URL:\"https://library.unt.edu/news/2018/oa2020/\")]. Effective January 2021, UNT requires that PIs for grants from all federal agencies and from others requiring a data-management plan (DMP) share the DMP and an inventory of grant products in the UNT Digital Library [(more, URL:\"https://research.unt.edu/research-services/pi-handbook/research-proposal-preparation/public-access-research-using-data\")].

        "page_content": "UNT Scholarly Works is hosted in the UNT Digital Library and operated by the UNT Libraries. For more information about UNT Scholarly Works, see ourwebpageorcontact us. TheUNT Open Access Policyhas two goals. For long-term stewardship of all scholarly work created by UNT Community Members, they are encouraged to deposit their works in theUNT Scholarly Worksinstitutional repository. A subset of those scholarly works, namely, the peer-reviewed, accepted-for-publication (post-peer review, pre-typeset) journal articles, is covered by the policy with the requirement of immediate deposit and the setting of the access level to Open Access upon deposit. However, the access level and the granting of the license to UNT by the author will be aligned with the publishers' policies. Further, the author can request, for an individual article, a waiver from granting the license, and the author can request a more restricted access level than what is allowed by a publishers' policy. The most common way is for UNT Community Members to email their materials to:untrepository@unt.edu. For more options, see theSubmissions pageabout UNT Scholarly Works. \"Open Access\" is a term commonly used for a movement that promotes free availability and unrestricted use of research and scholarship. Open Access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge to the reader, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions, so there are no price barriers and no permission barriers. No. The UNT Open Access (Policy, URL:\"https://openaccess.unt.edu/unt-open-access-policy\") refers to the accepted manuscripts and versions of record (seePolicyfor full definitions). Faculty members may continue to publish their preprints as they have been doing. There is no requirement for duplicate submissions of preprints in theUNT Scholarly Worksrepository, but faculty members are encouraged to deposit their preprints at UNT if they desire. Authors continue to prepare articles for publication in the same way they always have. The choice of journals in which to publish is left entirely to the authors. TheUNT Open Access Policyfosters publishing by encouraging scholars to also deposit their peer-reviewed, accepted for publication, journal articles into ourUNT Scholarly Worksrepository, which increases the value and impact of the research and provides wider dissemination. Open Access increases the visibility and impact of an authors' work, and allows for wider dissemination to colleagues and the greater academic community. Studies have shownincreased citationsfor articles that are available through Open Access instead of those only available through subscriptions. OurUNT Scholarly Worksrepository also provides viewable statistics, which can give UNT Community Members an additional measure of the impact of their work. RoMEO, part of the SHERPA Services Project, maintains a searchable database that tracks publisher copyright and self-archiving policies. RoMEO is a searchable database available to anyone, including UNT Community Members, and can be searched by Journal titles or publisher names to find the specific policies related to Open Access. In addition, you can contact theUNT Scholarly Worksrepository directly for information on a particular article, journal, or publisher. Yes. The University of North Texas (UNT) was the first public institution in the state of Texas to implement a policy in support of Open Access. After the UNT Faculty Senate voted overwhelmingly to support the policy on March 9, 2011, the policy, “Open Access, Self-Archiving, and Long-term Digital Stewardship for University of North Texas Scholarly Works“, was approved by the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs on February 1, 2012. For more information, please see thePolicypage. No. The journal publisher's existing policies regarding copyright and copyright transfer are not affected by the UNT Open Access Policy. To ensure the highest quality of content in the UNT Scholarly Works repository, the policy identifies for peer-reviewed, accepted-for-publication journal articles that an author deposits the \"accepted manuscript\" (i.e., version of record) if allowed by the publisher's policy. It is that version that is specified under the Policy. For any other scholarly works that a UNT Community Member wishes to deposit in our repository, the Policy notes that the author determines what constitutes the \"final version\" that is deposited. The UNT Scholarly Works repository follows strict guidelines, in accordance with statements in the UNT Open Access Policy, to ensure that the publishers' policies related to the extent of Open Access and self-archiving are followed. The guidelines make available only the version of work that is allowed by the publishers' policies (e.g., version submitted for publication, accepted manuscript, or final version).

He found Alcalá, who was the de facto leader of thegathering place. Full of charisma and stories, everybody liked to talk to him. And Aguirre likeddrawing his face. \"She had a very powerful story and I think I captured her personality in the portrait,\" Aguirre says. \"She put up a very strong persona. Once you started talking to her, she was a young girl. She had to act a certain way to protect herself.\" And then there was aguy from Tijuanawho was so happy with his portrait that he showed the drawing, which Aguirre gave to him, to his girlfriend. \"It sounded to me like they were often taken advantage of, and that's why I think gifts as small as a sketch were appreciated,\" Aguirre says. Aguirre puts a face to immigrants and day laborers whose stories are often untold. And Aguirre is getting attention for his work, with features inWestern Art & Architectureand being named one of the \"12 New Mexico Artists to Know Now\" bySouthwest Contemporary. \"For me the border has been an important factor in my life,\" he says. \"We need more voices advocating for immigrants.\" His inspiration is drawn from his own life experience. He grew up in Juarez, Mexico, and went to school in bordering El Paso. He has been drawing since he was a child -- and he noticed the murals in Juarez, especially one on a hospital's building wall that showed how health care was brought to the masses following the Mexican Revolution. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in graphic design from New Mexico State University, he wanted to study painting and chose UNT for the high reputation of theCollege of Visual Arts and Design. He learned from professors likeMatt Bourbon,Vincent FalsettaandAnnette Lawrence,whose work was often conceptual compared to Aguirre's traditional portraits. He said taking Lawrence's class was transformational in that he learned not every work had to be finished. \"Let the viewer use their imagination -- that's more powerful than finishing everything in a drawing,\" Aguirre says. Regularly, he adds color to the portrait but leaves the rest in black and white -- such as in this illustration of day laborerRicardo. \"One of the things that I like about drawing is that you can often see the hand of the artist. I render some areas more carefully, while in others, I leave the initial gestural marks. This gives it more energy. And with color you add another layer of emphasis.\" Approaching potential subjects is not always easy. He is shy, and the subjects can be reluctant, too. When he visits the camps for immigrants, he asks them if he can draw their portrait and explains what he's trying to do. \"That opens a lot of conversation. A lot of them are creative. You can start talking about other things and what they have aspirations for.\" His subjects are depicted holding papers or eating or waiting. He'll give them the drawing. He takes a picture that he will use to create the painting. Aguirre combines this work while managing the Learning Games Lab at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and teaches at El Paso Community College and Doña Ana County Community College in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He would eventually like to see his work exhibited at museums. But he's often satisfied with the work itself. \"Sometimes you get on a roll,\" he says. \"You kind of lose yourself. You're focused on painting. It's not necessarily relaxing but it's a good experience.\" (Disclaimer, URL:\"https://www.unt.edu/disclaimer\")|(AA/EOE/ADA, URL:\"https://www.unt.edu/ada\")|(Privacy, URL:\"https://www.unt.edu/privacy\")|(Electronic Accessibility, URL:\"https://policy.unt.edu/policy/14-005\")|(Required Links, URL:\"https://www.unt.edu/required-links\")|(UNT Home, URL:\"https://www.unt.edu\")",
